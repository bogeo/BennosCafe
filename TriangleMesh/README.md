# Triangle Mesh Project
In the context of the [GeologicToolbox](https://github.com/52north/GeologicToolbox) project, 
currently we are specifying abstract data types (ADTs) algebraically to model triangle meshes 
("triangulated irregular networks", TINs) as well as voxel structures.

You will find some CafeOBJ code describing the ADTs 'Vertex', 'Triangle', 'TriangleMesh',
'Tetrahedron' with respect to geospatial applications (e.g. geologic 3-D modelling, terrain
modelling etc.) here soon!#
