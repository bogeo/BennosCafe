# Triangle Mesh Project
In the context of the [GeologicToolbox](https://github.com/52north/GeologicToolbox) project, 
currently we are specifying abstract data types (ADTs) for triangle meshes ("triangulated 
irregular networks", TINs) as well as voxel structures.

You will find some CafeOBJ code describing the ADTs 'Vertex', 'Triangle', 'TriangleMesh',
'Tetrahedron' with repsect to geospatial application (e.g., but not only, geologic 3-D
modelling) here soon!
